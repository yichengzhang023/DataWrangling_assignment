    <Title>6.0 Scoring system</Title>
    <Description>The 6.0 system was divided into technical merit (in the free skate), required elements (in the short program), and presentation (in both programs). The marks for each program ranged from 0.0 to 6.0, the latter being the highest. These marks were used to determine a preference ranking, or ordinal, separately for each judge. The judges' preferences were then combined to determine placements for each skater in each program. The placements for the two programs were then combined with the free skate placement weighted more heavily than the short program. The individual with the lowest sum of the factored placements was declared the winner.</Description>

    <Title>Advantage</Title>
    <Description>Advantage is the period of time after an infringement, in which the non-offending side have the opportunity to gain sufficient territory or tactical opportunity to negate the need to stop the game due to the infringement. The referee will signal advantage with their arm out horizontally, toward the non-infringing team. If no tactical or territorial advantage is gained, the referee will whistle, and give the decision that had been delayed. If sufficient advantage is gained, the referee will call "advantage over", and play will continue. The Advantage Law allows the game to flow more freely, and not stop for every minor infringement. An example of the application of advantage would be if Team A knocked the ball on (technical offence, conceding a scrum) but a Team B player picked the ball up and made a run forwards before being tackled.</Description>

    <Title>Alpine Skiing (Paralympic Sport)</Title>
    <Description>Two Alpine Skiing events (Slalom and Giant Slalom) were introduced at the first Paralympic Winter Games in �rnsk�ldsvik, Sweden, in 1976. Athletes in Alpine Skiing events must combine speed and agility while racing down slopes at speeds of around 100km/h. Paralympic competition accommodates male and female athletes with a physical disability such as spinal injury, cerebral palsy, amputation, les autres conditions and blindness/visual impairment. Athletes compete in three categories based on their functional ability, and a results calculation system allows athletes with different disabilities to compete against each other. The rules of the International Ski Federation (FIS) are used with only a few modifications. Skiers with blindness /visual impairment are guided through the course by sighted guides using voice signals to indicate the course to follow. Athletes with physical disabilities use equipment that is adapted to their needs including single skis, sit-skis or orthopaedic aids. &#13;</Description>

    <Title>Athlete reported injuries</Title>
    <Description>Within the AMS platform, there is capability to collect athlete reported injuries. Timpka et al. (2014) reviewed the concept of a sports injury to align with World Health Organisation notion of impairment. The AIS will adopt their definition of athlete self-reported sports trauma. “An immediate sensation of pain, discomfort, or loss of functioning associated, by an athlete, with an isolated exposure to physical energy during sports training or competition having an intensity and quality making the sensation being interpreted by the athlete as discordant with normal body functioning”. This will be recorded in the Athlete Management System in the sessional monitoring form; however customisation of forms is possible.</Description>

Advances in technology and athletes dedication to the sport have made once unimaginable feats become realities.

    <Title>Athletics equipment (Paralympic Sport)</Title>
    <Description>Many athletics events require specific sports equipment for example the discus, shot or javelin.  In addition athletes may use certain assistive devices as specified in the IPC Athletics rules.  This technology continues to advance at a rapid rate. Wheelchairs are considered sports equipment in track and field events. Athletics wheelchairs tend to be very lightweight. The dimensions and features of wheelchairs are clearly specified in the IPC Athletics rules. Prosthetic devices may be used by amputees. These have been specifically developed to withstand the demands of sports competition. IPC rules require the use of leg prostheses in track events. However, the use of prostheses in field events is optional. Rope tethers or other devices may be used by runners with a visual impairment to link with their sighted guides. Acoustic devices, or a sighted caller, may be used to indicate take-off in jumping events, throwing target areas, etc. </Description>

    <Description>An audible is when a quarterback will change the play that was called in the huddle when he gets up to the line of scrimmage. He does this because of the way the defensive team has positioned itself and he thinks by changing the play he will be able to catch the defense in a wrong formation and make a big play on them. Or alternatively that the defensive team has positioned itself so that the play that was called in the huddle will not work and needs to be changed.</Description>

    <Title>Baseball</Title>
    <Description>Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players. The aim is to score runs by hitting a thrown ball with a bat and touching a series of four bases arranged at the corners of a ninety-foot diamond. Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to stop them from scoring runs by getting hitters out.</Description>

    <Title>Batting Order</Title>
    <Description>The batting order is the sequence in which batsmen go to the crease to bat. All eleven players in a cricket side must bat in an unlimited overs match unless a declaration is made. The batting order is usually subdivided into: opening batsmen or openers (the two batsmen who start, or open, the innings), upper or top order (batsmen at positions three and four in the order), middle order (batsmen five to seven), lower order or tail (batsmen eight to eleven). The order in which the eleven players will bat is usually established prior to the commencement of a cricket match, but may be altered during play. The decision is based on factors such as each player's specialities, the position each batsman will feel most comfortable in, each player's skills and attributes as a batsman, possible combinations with other batsmen, and the game situation, for example requiring a more defensive or attacking player at that point in the game.  </Description>

    <Title>Beamer (Cricket)</Title>
    <Description>A beamer (less commonly beam ball) is a type of delivery in which the ball bowled at a fast pace without bouncing, passes above the batsman's waist height.  Such a ball is often dangerously close to the batsman's head, due to the lack of control a bowler has over high full tosses. Worse, the batsman is expecting the ball to pitch on the wicket and therefore may not pick up the flight of the ball and may be struck by it. This type of delivery can result in injuries to the batsman, and the penalty for this type of delivery is an immediate no-ball signal given by the umpire.</Description>

    <Title>Biathlon (Paralympic Sport)</Title>
    <Description>Biathlon was introduced in Lillehammer in 1994. The competition is open to athletes with a physical disability and blindness / visual impairment. It consists of a 7.5km route divided into three 2.5km stages.Between the two stages athletes must hit two targets located at a distance of 10 metres. Each miss is penalised by an increase in the overall route time. The most important success factor lies in the capability of alternating the skills of physical endurance and shooting accuracy during the competition. Athletes with blindness/visual impairment are assisted by acoustic signals, which depending on signal intensity, indicate when the athlete is on target.&#13;</Description>

    <Title>Blitz Defence</Title>
    <Description>The blitz defence is a defensive technique similar to the defence used in rugby league. It relies on the whole defensive line moving forward towards their marked man as one, as soon as the ball leaves the base of a ruck or maul. The charge is usually led by the inside centre.&#13;&#13;The idea of this technique is to prevent the attacking team gaining any ground by tackling them behind the gain line and forcing interceptions and charged down kicks. However, the defending team can be vulnerable to chip kicks and any player breaking the defensive line will have lots of space to play because the defence are running the other way and must stop, turn and chase.&#13;</Description>

    <Title>Boat (Adaptive Rowing) (Paralympic Sport)</Title>
    <Description>The hull of the adaptive rowing boat is identical to able-bodied boats. Adaptive rowing boats are equipped with special seats, which vary according to the disability of the rower. To date, there are no other specifications on the seat apart from the following: the LTA4+ has a sliding seat; the other three boat classes have fixed seats. The TA 2x has a seat, which offers complimentary support. The AW1x and AM1x are equipped with a seat, which offers postural support to those individuals with compromised sitting balance (i.e. spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy). This ensures that the upper body is supported and kept in a fixed position. Smaller boats are equipped with buoyancy devices called pontoons, which act as stabilisers attached to the boats riggers, providing additional lateral balance.&#13;</Description>

    <Title>Bobsled</Title>
    <Description>Modern day sleds combine light metals, steel runners, and an aerodynamic composite body. Competition sleds must be a maximum of 3.80 m (12.5 ft) long (4-crew) or 2.70 m (8.9 ft) long (2-crew). The runners on both are set at 0.67 m (2.2 ft) gauge. Until the weight-limit rule was added in 1952, bobsleigh crews tended to be very heavy to ensure the greatest possible speed. Now, the maximum weight, including crew, is 630 kg (1,388.9 lbs) (4-man), 390 kg (859.8 lbs) (2-man), or 340 kg (749.6 lbs) (2-woman), which can be reached via the addition of metal weights.&#13;&#13;</Description>

    <Title>Bonus Points</Title>
    <Description>Bonus points are a method of deciding table points from a rugby union match. It was implemented in order to encourage attacking play throughout a match, to discourage repetitive goal-kicking, and to reward teams for "coming close" in losing efforts.  Under the standard system, 1 bonus point is awarded for scoring 4 (or more) tries and 1 bonus point for losing by 7 points (or fewer).   The French professional league replaces the four-try bonus point with a point for a win in which the winning team scores at least 3 more tries than its opponent.</Description>

    <Title>Bound </Title>
    <Description>The bound is a jump that allows the bowler to transition from the run-up to the back foot contact position. For a chest on bowler not much transition is needed. So, many chest on bowlers have a low, short bound. In contrast, side on bowlers need to rotate their bodies through ninety degrees and so tend to have a longer, higher bound. A high bound can lead to the knee on the back foot collapsing and so lose momentum.</Description>

    <Title>Box</Title>
    <Description>A trapezoidal indentation in the ground with a metal or fiberglass covering at the end of the runway in which vaulters "plant" their pole. The back wall of the box is nearly vertical and is approximately 8 inches in depth. The bottom of the box gradually slopes upward approximately 3-feet until it is level with the runway. The covering in the box ensures the pole will slide to the back of the box without catching on anything. The covering's lip overlaps onto the runway and ensures a smooth transition from all-weather surface so a pole being planted does not catch on the box.</Description>

    <Title>Breakdown</Title>
    <Description>The breakdown is a colloquial term for the period immediately after a tackle and the ensuing ruck. During this time teams compete for possession of the ball, initially with their hands and then using feet in the ruck. Most referees will call "ruck" or "hands away" as soon as a ruck is formed. Most infringements take place at the breakdown, owing to the greater variety of possible offences at a breakdown, for example handling in the ruck, killing the ball, offside at the ruck and so on.</Description>

    <Title>Canoe (Paralympic Sport)</Title>
    <Description>Canoe was introduced as a Paralympic sport at the 2016 Rio Paralympic Games.&#13;&#13;In the Paralympic Games there is only the sprint discipline.&#13;The Olympic and Paralympic versions have similar rules, with the fastest canoeist winning. The competition format features direct classification to the finals and repechage heats to decide which athletes will take part in the final race, in which medals are won.&#13;In the Paralympic Games, only kayaks, identified by the letter K, are used. Each boat is adapted according to the functional abilities of its crew members. Athletes with any type of physical-motor disability may participate in competitions.&#13;There are three functional classes: LTA, where athletes use their legs, trunk and arms to help rowing; TA, in which athletes use only their trunk and arms; and A, in which athletes only use their arms.&#13;Events are always held along straight line courses marked by buoys, 200 metres long. There are both men’s and women’s races, with events for individuals.</Description>

    <Title>Chin Music</Title>
    <Description>Chin music is a term for a bowling strategy where bouncers are aimed at the batsman's throat or chin.  Rising rapidly off the pitch, the ball is difficult to play unless the batsman has quick footwork. Better left alone, it yields a ballooned return catch to the bowler or to close-in fielders. This is a difficult ball to bowl, since a few inches on either side would present the batsman with a short ball that can be easily put away on either side of the pitch. It is not illegal in cricket, but the number of short deliveries allowed in an over is usually restricted, and bowlers who exceed this may get a warning from the umpire. This tactic was made famous by the England team in the controversial 'Bodyline' Ashes series in 1932.</Description>

    <Title>Conversion</Title>
    <Description>If a team scores a try, they have an opportunity to "convert" it for two further points by kicking the ball between the posts and above the crossbar - that is, through the goal. The kick is taken at any point on the field of play in line with the point that the ball was grounded for the try parallel to the touch-lines. So it is advatageous to score a try nearer to the posts as it is easier to convert it.  The kick can be either a drop kick or a place kick in the 15-man game. However, in sevens, all conversions must be drop kicks.</Description>

The term crease is also used to refer to the lines themselves (but only the back edge of the line, i.e. the edge nearest to the wicket at that end, as this is the actual crease), particularly the popping crease.

Four creases (one popping crease, one bowling crease, and two return creases) are drawn at each end of the pitch, around the two sets of stumps. The batsmen generally play in and run between the areas defined by the creases at each end of the pitch. </Description>

    <Title>Crimes Act 1914</Title>
    <Description>The Crimes Act  outlines crimes against the Commonwealth. Several parts of the Act relate to records. For example, section 70 prohibits public servants (or anyone working for the Australian Government including contractors and consultants) publishing or communicating facts, documents, or information which they gain access to through their work, unless they have permission to do so. This includes taking or selling records which should be destroyed. This Act also makes it an offence for someone to intentionally destroy documents that they know may be required as evidence in a judicial proceeding.&#13;</Description>

    <Title>Dead Ball</Title>
    <Description>A dead ball is a particular state of play in which the players may not perform any of the active aspects of the game. In other words, batsmen may not score runs and fielders may not attempt to get batsmen out. The ball, referring to the cricket ball, becomes live when the bowler begins his run up in preparation to bowling at the batsman. In the live state, play occurs with the batsmen able to score runs and get out. The ball then becomes dead when any of the following situations occur. The umpire is satisfied that, with adequate reason, the batsman is not ready for the delivery of the ball. The ball passes the batsman, is gathered by the wicket-keeper, and the batsmen obviously decline to attempt to take runs.  The ball is finally settled in the hands of the wicket-keeper or the bowler, and the batsmen obviously decline to attempt to take any more runs.  The umpire feels that both the fielding team and the batsmen consider the ball no longer to be in play. The ball reaches the boundary and four runs or six runs are scored. Either batsman is out. The ball lodges in the clothing or equipment of a batsman or umpire. The ball lodges in a protective helmet worn by a fielder. The batsmen attempt to run leg byes, and, in the umpire's opinion, no attempt was made either to hit the ball with the bat or to evade it. This nullifies the leg byes. The umpire intervenes in the occurrence of injury or unfair play.</Description>

    <Description>The Duckworth / Lewis method (D/L method) is a mathematical way to calculate the target score for the team batting second in a one-day cricket or Twenty20 cricket match interrupted by weather or other circumstance. It is generally accepted to be a fair and accurate method of setting a target score, but as it attempts to predict what would have happened had the game come to its natural conclusion, it generates some controversy. The D/L method was devised by two English statisticians, Frank Duckworth and Tony Lewis.</Description>

    <Title>Dump tackle</Title>
    <Description>It is a tackling technique. The tackler wraps their arms around the ball carrier's thighs and lifts them a short distance in the air before forcibly driving them to the ground. The tackler must go to ground with the ball carrier for the tackle to be legal. This technique is useful to completely stop the opponent in their tracks. A dump tackle which drops the ball carrier on their head or neck is known as a spear tackle, and will almost invariably concede a penalty and possibly result in a caution for the tackler.</Description>

    <Title>Equestrian (Paralympic Sport)</Title>
    <Description>Although used for many years for rehabilitation and recreation, equestrian as a sport was included in the program of the Paralympic Games for the first time in Atlanta in 1996. Equestrian is a multi-disability sport open to athletes with a physical disability or a visual impairment. Events are mixed and grouped according to their functional profiles. Riders compete in two Dressage events, a Championship Test of set movements and a Freestyle Test to music. There is also a Team test for three to four riders per team. Competitors are judged on their display of horsemanship skills as they ride their horse using a series of commands for walk, trot and canter. Riders may use permitted assistive devices such as dressage crops, a connecting rein bar, rubber bands or other aids. Since 2006, the International Equestrian Federation is the governing body for equestrian.</Description>

    <Title>eTID</Title>
    <Description>eTID is an online electronic talent identification tool that is simple to use, free and allows anyone (aged 12-29) to assess their sporting potential.  eTID is the brainchild of the Australian Sports Commission's successful National Talent Identification and Development (NTID) program which seeks to identify and develop Australia's future sporting talent. This interactive website allows users to enter in results for a series of simple 'home based' performance tests and measurements which can be used to help identify athletes for selection in NTID development programs.  Accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime, eTID provides opportunities for aspiring or current athletes and even former elite athletes looking to start a new sport. The General Tests section caters for would-be champions aged 12-25 whilst the Sport Specific and Elite Athlete sections will consider athletic hopefuls up to the age of 29.  If your results are identified as above average you will be encouraged to visit a Talent Assessment Centre (TAC) to have your results verified. After assessment, you may then be able to enter the elite sporting system, where you could be supported with coaching, equipment and travel.</Description>

    <Title>Exposure measures</Title>
    <Description>The National Injury and Illness Database includes are wide variety of sports ranging from on-water sports (rowing, sailing, canoe/kayak) to in-water sports (diving, swimming, water polo) to athletics, cycling, field team sports (rugby 7’s and hockey) and gymnastics. We propose the “per available training days” as the most pragmatic definition. Similarly to clinical epidemiological studies, this exposure should be normalised to a set amount of days. Therefore, we propose the exposure be reported in “per 100 athlete training days” as this is easily interpreted by a range of backgrounds from governing bodies’ personnel to coaches. For example, a coach with 10 athletes and an incidence rate of 0.5 shoulder injuries per 100 days can expect to see 5 shoulder injuries per 100 days of training. The “per 1000 hours” method, the accepted gold standard in the literature, requires further calculations for the coach estimation example. Furthermore, sports such as equestrian who are spread across 4 continents and train on multiple horses each day may not be able to provide the data in the same level as a swimming group using the same pool each day.</Description>

    <Title>Extra</Title>
    <Description>An extra (sometimes called a sundry) is a run scored by a means other than a batsman hitting the ball. Other than runs scored off the bat from a no ball, a batsman is not given credit for extras and the extras are tallied separately on the scorecard and count only towards the team's score.

    <Title>Fast Bowler</Title>
    <Description>Fast bowling, sometimes known as pace bowling, is one of the two main approaches to bowling in the sport of cricket. The other is spin bowling. Practitioners are usually known as fast bowlers or pace bowlers although sometimes the label used refers to the specific fast bowling technique the bowler prefers, such as swing bowler or seam bowler.&#13;&#13;The main aim of fast bowling is to bowl the hard cricket ball at high speed and to induce it to bounce off the pitch in an erratic fashion or move sideways through the air, factors which make it difficult for the batsman to hit the ball cleanly.</Description>

    <Title>Feeding the Scrum</Title>
    <Description>To roll the ball into the scrum.  Technically, the ball should enter the scrum via the tunnel formed by the front row forwards of the two teams binding together, with both teams able to strike for the ball, but a relaxed application of the rule is practised. The relaxed application allows players to roll the ball more directly into their team's side of the scrum thus reducing the chances of the other team successfully striking for the ball and gaining possession of it. "Feeding!" is an ironic accusation sometimes called out by spectators of a game in response to a player taking advantage of the modern application of the rule.</Description>

    <Description>Female or Intersex female athletes with elevated androgen production may be of concern within some competitive sports. In general, the performances of male and female athletes may differ mainly due to the fact that men produce significantly more androgenic hormones than women and, therefore, are under stronger influence of such hormones. Androgenic hormones have performance enhancing effects, particularly on strength, power and speed, which may provide a competitive advantage in sports. Within some sports and sport competitions investigations may be held to evaluate a suspected cases of female hyperandrogenism.</Description>

    <Title>Fielding</Title>
    <Description>Fielding in the sport of cricket is the action of fielders in collecting the ball after it is struck by the batsman, in such a way as to either limit the number of runs that the batsman scores or get the batsman out by catching the ball in flight or running the batsman out. A fielder or fieldsman may field the ball with any part of his person. However, if while the ball is in play he wilfully fields it otherwise (e.g. by using his hat), the ball becomes dead and 5 penalty runs are awarded to the batting side unless the ball previously struck a batsman not attempting to hit or avoid the ball. Most of the rules covering fielders are in Law 41 of the Laws of cricket.</Description>

    <Title>First Slip</Title>
    <Description>In the sport of cricket, a slip fielder (collectively, a slip cordon or the slips) is placed behind the batsman on the off side of the field. They are placed with the aim of catching an edged ball which is beyond the wicket-keeper's reach. Many teams employ two or three slips (numbered from the slip fielder closest to the wicket-keeper: first slip, second slip, etc.). A floating slip is sometimes employed, usually in limited over games, who patrols an area in the slip cordon that would ordinarily be occupied by more than one fielder. The slip cordon's distance from the batsman increases with the pace of the bowler. Generally they will be marginally further away from the batsman than the wicketkeeper is. Because of the resulting geometry, spin bowlers generally have fewer slips in the cordon than a fast bowler would in an equivalent game situation. As fielding in the slips requires quick reflexes and sure hands, usually the most adept catchers in the team will make up the slip cordon. Most slip fielders are top order batsmen. Specialist slip fielders are sometimes called slippers.</Description>

    <Title>Flanker</Title>
    <Description>Also known as breakaways or wing forwards. They are the players wearing shirts numbers 6 &amp; 7. They are the players with the fewest set responsibilities. The player should have all round attributes: speed, strength, fitness, tackling and handling skills. Flankers are always involved in the game, as they are the real ball winners at the breakdown, especially the number 7. The two flankers do not usually bind to the scrum in a fixed position. Instead, the openside flanker will attach to the scrum on whichever side is further from the nearer touchline, while the blindside flanker attaches themself to the scrum on the side closer to the touchline.</Description>

    <Title>Follow On</Title>
    <Description>Follow-on is a term used in the sport of cricket to describe a situation where the team that bats second is forced to take its second batting innings immediately after its first, because the team was not able to get close enough (within 200 runs for a five-day match) to the score achieved by the first team batting in the first innings. In matches when each team has only one innings of batting, follow-on in such a case is obviously not applicable - it is found only in the longer (more traditional) two-innings each match.</Description>

There are five players on each team and the game lasts 50 minutes. Rules are similar to the able-bodied game with a few modifications.

    <Title>Forward Defence</Title>
    <Description>The forward defence is one of the most commonly-used shots in cricket.&#13;&#13;Played to a good length ball, the batsman attempts to defend his wicket by smothering the ball before it has had much opportunity to spin or move off the seam. With a well-bent front knee, the shot can also help combat variable bounce.&#13;&#13;Whilst the shot is a defensive one, there can be opportunities to score from it, if the shot is particularly well-timed, or if the batsmen run a quick single.&#13;</Description>

    <Title>Forward Pass (Rugby)</Title>
    <Description>It is called a throw-forward in the laws of the game.  A forward pass occurs when the ball fails to travel backwards in a pass. If the ball is not thrown or passed forward but it bounces forward after hitting a player or the ground, it is not a throw-forward.  If the referee deems it accidental, this results in a scrum to the opposing team, however deliberate forward passes result in the award of a penalty.</Description>

    <Title>Free Hit (Cricket)</Title>
    <Description>Free hit is a cricket terminology, relevant in one day internationals and Twenty20 matches. When a bowler bowls a front-foot no ball, in the immediate next ball, the batsman cannot be ruled out in any dismissal modes, other than run out, handling the ball, hitting the ball twice and obstructing the field. This freedom enables the batsman to play a powerful shot without the fear of getting out caught, bowled or leg before. For this reason, the delivery immediately after a front-foot no ball is called a free hit. It came into International Cricket in October 2007.</Description>

    <Title>Full Toss</Title>
    <Description>A full toss is a type of delivery in the sport of cricket. It describes any delivery that reaches the batsman without bouncing on the pitch first.  Full tosses are sparingly bowled deliberately, as they defeat the purpose of most types of delivery, which is to deceive the batsman by bouncing unpredictably on the pitch. They are commonly greeted with delight by a batsman, as they tend to be very easy to hit. A full toss is frequently the result of an unintentional error made while attempting to bowl a yorker, which would land around the batsman's feet.  </Description>

    <Description>The course is longer, there are fewer turns, and the turns are wider and smoother than the Slalom. The number of gates is determined by the vertical drop and the penalty for missing a gate is disqualification. Each athlete completes two runs on the same day on different courses. Times from the two courses are added to determine order of finish. (The ranking in the first run is the basis for the starting order in the second run, with the fastest skiing last).</Description>

    <Title>Goalball</Title>
    <Description>Goalball is a sport exclusively for athletes who are blind or have a visual impairment. It was invented in 1946 in an effort to rehabilitate the blind veterans from World War II and made its Paralympic debut in 1976 in Toronto. Goalball competitions are set apart from all other Paralympic events due to the unique atmosphere inside the playing venue. The object is to roll the ball into the opponent's goal while the opposing players try to block the ball with their bodies. Bells inside the ball help to orientate the players by indicating the direction of the oncoming ball. Therefore, while play is in progress, complete silence is required in the venue to allow the players to concentrate and react instantly to the ball. Goalball is played by male and female athletes with blindness / visual impairment and athletes wear blackout masks on the playing court. This allows persons with varying degrees of vision to participate together. The game consists of two halves of 10 minutes each.  </Description>

    <Title>Golden Point</Title>
    <Description>The golden point, a sudden death overtime system, is sometimes used to resolve drawn rugby league matches. Minor variations exist to this system. In the National Rugby League, if the scores are level at the end of 80 minutes, 5 minutes are played, the teams swap ends with no break, and a further 5 minutes are played. Any score (try, penalty goal, or field goal) in this 10 minute period secures a win for the scoring team, and the game ends at that point.</Description>

    <Title>Handicap</Title>
    <Description>A handicap is a numerical measure of a golfer's potential playing ability based on the tees played for a given course. It is used to calculate a net score from the number of strokes actually played during a competition, thus allowing players of different proficiency to play against each other on somewhat equal terms. The higher the handicap of a player, the poorer the player is relative to those with lower handicaps. Handicap systems are not used in professional golf.</Description>

    <Title>Hip Bursitis</Title>
    <Description>A bursa is a small sack of fluid which is usually positioned in between a bone and a muscle or tendon. The function of a bursa is to prevent friction between the bone and overlying soft tissue. The most commonly injured bursa is the trochanteric bursa. This can be injured in one of two ways, through a direct impact to the bursa, such as a fall onto the outer hip, known as traumatic bursitis. Or through repetitive friction from the overlying muscles and tendons, usually during running. This repeated friction results in the bursa becoming inflamed and swollen. Every time the tendons then rub over the bursa, this causes pain.</Description>

    <Title>Hit Wicket</Title>
    <Description>Hit wicket is a method of dismissal in the sport of cricket. This method of dismissal is governed by Law 35 of the laws of cricket. The striker is out "hit wicket" if, after the bowler has entered his delivery stride and while the ball is in play, his wicket is put down by his bat or his person. The striker may do this whilst preparing to receive or receiving a delivery or in setting off for his first run after playing the delivery. In simple language if the striking batsman knocks the bails off the stumps or uproots the stumps, while attempting to hit the ball or take off for a run, he is out hit wicket.</Description>

    <Title>Hooker</Title>
    <Description>Hookers traditionally wear the number 2 shirt. The hooker is the player who is in the centre position of the front row of the scrum and who uses his /her feet to 'hook' the ball back. Due to the pressure put on the body by the scrum and the requirement to use both arms to bind to other players (and hence having no free arm to use to support or deflect bodyweight) it is considered to be one of the most dangerous positions to play.  Hookers normally throw the ball in at line-outs, partly because they are normally the shortest of the forwards, but more often because they are the most skillful of the forwards.  </Description>

    <Description>Ice Sledge Hockey is the Paralympic version of Ice Hockey. Since its debut on the Paralympic Programme at the Lillehammer 1994 Winter Paralympics, it has quickly become one of the largest attractions for spectators at the Winter Paralympics. It is fast-paced, highly physical and played by male athletes with a physical disability in the lower part of the body. It follows the rules of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) with modifications. Instead of skates, players use two-blade sledges that allow the puck to pass beneath. Players use two sticks, which have a spike-end for pushing and a blade-end for shooting. Ic Sledge Hockey is an 8 Team Tournament.&#13;</Description>

    <Title>Indoor Archery</Title>
    <Description>Indoor Archery is performed similarly to traditional archery. &#13;All indoor events are conducted to the same format. &#13;Arrows are shot in 3-arrow ends with a 2 minute time limit, with a 10 second call to the shooting line and a warning (amber light) when there is 30 seconds to the completion of the end of shooting.&#13;Usually 4 archers are allocated to a target butt and archers shoot in two details, AB and CD.&#13;For the WA Indoor Rounds, when shooting at single or triangular triple faces Archer A shoots at the top left target with Archer B shooting at the top right target. Archer C will shoot at the bottom left target and Archer D at the bottom right target.&#13;When shooting vertical triple faces, the four vertical strips are placed side by side and Archer A shoots at the first column from the left while Archer B shoots at the third column from the left. Archer C the second column and Archer D the fourth column.&#13;When shooting, the order of shooting will rotate each end, as follows:&#13;&#13;            AB - CD&#13;            CD - AB&#13;            AB - CD&#13;            etc&#13;&#13;For the Australian Indoor Rounds when shooting at single or triangular triple faces, the archers on the lower targets will always shoot first.&#13;When shooting a single 30-arrow round, after 15 arrows the archers on the top targets will move their targets to the lower positions and the archers shooting on the lower targets will move their targets to the upper target positions.&#13;If shooting a double round, this change will happen after 30 arrows have been shot.</Description>

    <Title>Indoor Cricket</Title>
    <Description>Indoor cricket is a modified form of Cricket. It involves two teams, each having two batsmen, a bowler and a team of fielders. The bowler bowls the ball to the batsmen who must score runs. The team with the highest score at the end of the match wins.&#13;&#13;Indoor cricket is played on a rectangular, artificial-grass surfaced court. The court is enclosed in tightly tensioned netting, including a 4 metre high roof. The length of the pitch and size of the stumps are exactly the same dimensions as traditional outdoor cricket.&#13;&#13;Within Indoor cricket each team consists of a maximum of 8 players (minimum of 6), each team bats for 1 innings and bowls for 1 innings of 16 overs (total 32 over game). An over consists of 8 balls or deliveries (variations may occur) and a bowler cannot bowl consecutive overs. Each batting pair may bat for 4 overs and dismissals gain a 5 run deduction from the score.</Description>

    <Title>Indoor Hockey</Title>
    <Description>Indoor field hockey, or indoor hockey, is an indoor variant of "traditional" outdoor field hockey. It is traditionally and mainly played as a pastime by outdoor field hockey players during the off-season, when outdoor pitches are frozen or, alternatively, when conditions are too hot for outdoor play. Indoor hockey differs from outdoor hockey in a number of ways. There are fewer players in an indoor hockey team with teams comprising a maximum of 12 players with only five, including the goalkeeper, allowed on the pitch at any one time and up to seven substitutes. The field of play is much smaller, a hard surface in a sports hall or similar venue, with boards along the sidelines that prevent the ball from going out of play at the side.</Description>

    <Title>Inning</Title>
    <Description>A period of play. There are 9 innings in a regulation game, each team bats in an inning until they record 3 outs. The visiting team always bats in the top half (beginning) of an inning. If the home team has a higher total after their opponents bat in the top half of the last schedule inning, the bottom half of the inning is not played and the score is final. A tie at the end of regulation play forces extra innings. The game continues until an inning is complete and the visitors have a higher score, or until the home team breaks the tie then they don’t complete the 3 outs.</Description>

    <Title>Innings</Title>
    <Description>An inning, or innings, is a fixed-length segment of a game in any of a variety of sports � most notably cricket and baseball during which one team attempts to score while the other team attempts to prevent the first from scoring.   In many other sports, the length of the game is dictated by a clock and teams swap offensive and defensive roles dynamically by taking possession of a ball or similar item. In baseball and cricket, however, one team said to be batting, attempts to score runs while the other team, said to be fielding, attempts to prevent the scoring of runs and get members of the batting team out. The teams switch places after the fielding team has succeeded in getting a fixed number of players out, making a clock unnecessary.  In cricket, the term innings is also used to refer to the play of one particular player.  The baseball-derived parallel to this in American English is the term at bat. </Description>

    <Title>Interleukin 6</Title>
    <Description>A substance produced in response to injury or trauma of tissue by specialized white blood cells called T-cells, as well as macrophages and endothelial cells. As the name implies, this substance is an interleukin. However, it also classified as a cytokine, meaning that it is involved in relaying information between cells as both a signaling molecule and a signaling protein. As such, interleukin-6 may behave as both an anti-inflammatory agent and a pro-inflammatory mediator, depending on certain conditions. While interleukin-6 is manufactured naturally in the body, it can also be synthesized in a laboratory. </Description>

    <Description>Joint pain can be due to any number of causes, from injuries, to medical conditions. Generally, joint pain is a dull pain which cannot be pin-pointed to a specific area. It is most common in the hips and knees. Pain which is localised to one joint is usually a specific condition or injury at the joint in question. Multiple joint pain should be investigated for more systemic (whole body) conditions.</Description>

    <Title>Kick Off</Title>
    <Description>A coin is tossed and the winning captain either chooses which direction their team shall play, or elects to take the kick that starts the game. Both halves of the match are started with a drop kick from the centre-point of the halfway line. The kick must cross the opposition's 10-metre line, unless played by a member of the receiving team. The opposition are not allowed to encroach beyond the 10-metre line until the ball is kicked.  If the ball does not travel 10 metres goes straight into touch or goes over the dead ball line at the end of the pitch the opposing team may accept the kick, have the ball kicked off again, or have a scrum at the centre.  After a score the game is restarted from the same place under the same restrictions with the conceding team drop-kicking the ball to the scoring team. However, in sevens, the scoring team kicks off.</Description>

    <Title>Korfball</Title>
    <Description>Korfball (Dutch: Korfbal) is a ball sport, with similarities to netball and basketball. It is played by two teams of eight players with either eight females in each team or with four females and four males in each team. The objective is to throw a ball through a bottomless basket (Korf) that is mounted on a 3.5 m (11.5 feet) high pole.&#13;Teams of eight players divide into two sections, two male, two female in each section. The korfball playing area consists of two large squares joined along the centre line, within each square is a ‘korf’ set in one third from the back line.&#13;The sport was developed in the Netherlands by school-teacher Nico Broekhuysen who founded the sport in 1902 so that boys and girls could play together on equal terms, encouraging team work and cooperation.&#13;One section starts the game in attack, the other in defence, but players swap roles after every two goals scored throughout the game.&#13;The sport is based on cooperation within the team, and the rules provide equality – players can only mark or be marked by an opposing player of the same sex.&#13;Individual challenges and competitiveness are still enjoyed within this framework that priorities teamwork and equality.</Description>

    <Title>Lane (Oval track)</Title>
    <Description>The 400m standard track has eight, six or occasionally four lanes. The distance of the race is measured from the edge of the start line further from the finish to the edge of the finish line nearer to the start. &#13;&#13;All lanes have a width of 1.22m ± 0.01 and are marked by white lines 5cm wide. The line on the right hand of each lane, in the direction of running, is included in the measurement of the width of each lane. All start lines (except for the curved start lines) and the finish line are marked at right angles to the lane lines. &#13;&#13;The essential requirement for all start lines ─ straight, narrow, staggered or curved ─ is that the distance for every athlete is the same. For races of 800m or less, each athlete will have a separate lane at the start. Races of up to, and including, 400m are run entirely in lanes. Races of 800m start and continue in lanes until the end of the first bend. The exit from the first bend is marked distinctively with a 5cm wide line across the track and is called the breakline. The breakline is marked at each end by a flag at least 1.5m high, positioned outside the track, 30cm from the nearest lane line. Races over 800m are run without lanes using a curved start line.&#13;&#13;Immediately before the finish line, the lanes are marked with numbers a minimum height of 0.50m. All markings are 0.05m wide.  All distances are measured in a clockwise direction from the edge of the finish&#13;line nearer to the start to the edge of the start line farther from the finish.&#13;&#13;All track specifications are dictated by the IAAF Track and Field Manual.</Description>

    <Title>Late Tackle</Title>
    <Description>A late tackle is a tackle executed on a player who has already passed or kicked away the ball. As it is illegal to tackle a player who does not have the ball, Late tackles are penalty offences (referees allow a short margin of error where the tackler was already committed to the tackle) and if severe or reckless may result in yellow or red Cards.  If a late tackle occurs after a kick and a penalty is awarded, the non-offending team has the option of taking the penalty where the ball landed.</Description>

    <Title>Leg Before Wicket</Title>
    <Description>In the sport of cricket, leg before wicket (LBW) is one of the ways in which a batsman can be dismissed. An umpire will rule a batsman out LBW under a complex series of circumstances that primarily include the ball striking the batsman's body (usually the leg) when it would otherwise have continued on to hit the wicket. The LBW rule is designed to prevent a batsman simply using his body to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket (and so avoid being bowled out) rather than using his bat to do so.  &#13;Despite the word leg in leg before wicket, the rule applies if the ball hits the batsman on any part of his body, except for the glove of a hand in contact with the bat (which is considered part of the bat).</Description>

    <Title>Leg Cutter</Title>
    <Description>A leg cutter is a type of delivery in the sport of cricket. It is bowled by fast bowlers.  A bowler releases a normal fast delivery with the wrist locked in position and the first two fingers positioned on top of the cricket ball, giving it spin about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the length of the pitch. For a leg cutter, a right-handed bowler pulls his fingers down the left side of the ball (from his viewpoint), rolling the ball out of his hand over the little finger, in an action similar to bowling a leg break, only at higher speed. This changes the axis of spin to make it more like a leg break, which makes the ball deviate to the left when it bounces on the pitch. From a right-handed batsman's point of view, this deviation is to the right, or from the leg side towards the off side. This deviation is known as cut, and the delivery is called a leg cutter because it moves away from the leg side.</Description>

    <Title>Leg Spin</Title>
    <Description>Leg spin is a style of spin bowling in cricket. A leg spinner bowls right-arm with a wrist spin action, causing the ball to spin anti-clockwise at the point of delivery. When the ball bounces, the spin causes the ball to deviate sharply from right to left, away from the leg side of a right-handed batsman, which is the origin of the name "leg spin". The same action when performed by a left-arm bowler is known as left-arm unorthodox spin or "chinaman" bowling.</Description>

    <Title>Line Out</Title>
    <Description>A maximum of seven and a minimum of two forwards line up parallel with each other between the five-metre and 15-metre lines. The hooker of the team in possession throws the ball in while his opposite number [may] stand in between the touchline and the five-metre line. (Note, from August 1st 2008 the IRB is conducting a global trial of a modification to this Law which requires the opposing player to stand no closer than 2m to the other players in the line out.)  All players not involved in the lineout, except the scrum-half, must retire 10 metres.  &#13;The ball must be thrown in straight down the middle of the lineout and the hooker must not cross into the field of play while throwing in. If throw is not straight then the throw is given to opposition or a scrum.  Jumpers can be lifted by their team-mates below the waist, but the opposition's jumpers must not be obstructed, barged or pulled down.</Description>

    <Title>Long Hop</Title>
    <Description>A long hop is a type of inadvertent delivery in the sport of cricket. It describes a short delivery which is not especially fast, which is thus easy for the batsman to hit because he has plenty of time to observe the speed and direction of the ball after the bounce and choose his shot accordingly. In contrast, a fast short delivery which bounces high (to the batsman's chest or higher) is termed a bouncer and is often bowled deliberately because it is difficult to safely hit, due to the height at which it reaches the batsman.</Description>

    <Title>Mark</Title>
    <Description>A mark is the place where the game will restart after a stoppage, such as where a scrum-offence or penalty offence occurred, or on the touchline where the ball went out of play (or where the ball was kicked in the case of ball-back). Marks are generally defined by the referee, or the touch judge when the ball leaves play by the touchline.  Marks can also be defined by a defending players who execute a clean catch (catch the ball before it bounces or touches another player) of a ball kicked by an attacking player if the defender is standing within his / her own 22 metre zone or in-goal. To "call a mark", the player shouts "Mark!" as he/she catches the ball. The referee then awards that player a free kick which must be taken by that specific player. (If for whatever reason, that player cannot take the kick, a scrum is awarded instead.) If the player is simply a poor kicker he / she is likely to take a 'Tap Kick' and immediately pass the ball to the fly-half or full back who will generally deliver a clearance kick.  Marks can be called when the ball is cleanly caught following a kick by the opposition for any type of kick except a kick off or restart after a score. It is legal, though very unusual, to call a mark from a clean catch of a Penalty Kick.  </Description>

    <Title>Maul</Title>
    <Description>When a ball carrier is held up (without being tackled) by both an opposing player and a player from their own team, a maul is then considered formed.&#13;&#13;The offside line becomes the last foot of the last person on each side of the maul. Players can only join in from behind that team-mate. Anyone who comes in from the sides will be penalised by the referee. Hands are allowed to be used in the maul. If either team deliberately collapses the maul then that side will be penalised by the referee. (Note that from August 1st 2008, the IRB is conducting a global trial of a modification of this Law which will allow players to deliberately collapse a maul providing the collapse is achieved buy pulling from above the waist.)&#13;&#13;If the ball does not come out in a timely fashion, the referee will award a scrum to the team that did not take the ball into the maul.&#13;&#13;Mauls can only exist in the field of play. Play that looks like a maul can exist within the in-goal but restrictions on entry to the maul and the need to bind on to a team member do not apply.</Description>

    <Title>Medial Cartilage Meniscus Injury</Title>
    <Description>Each knee joint has two crescent-shaped cartilage menisci. These lie on the medial (inside) and lateral (outside) of the upper surface of the tibia (shin) bone. They are essential components of the knee, acting as shock absorbers as well as allowing for the proper interaction and weight distribution between the tibia and the femur (thigh bone). As a result, injury to either meniscus can lead to critical impairment of the knee itself.&#13;&#13;</Description>

    <Title>Medial Ligament Sprain</Title>
    <Description>The Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) connects the inner (medial) surfaces of the femur (thigh bone) and the tibia (shin bone). Its function is to resist forces applied from the outer surface of the knee and so prevent the medial (inner) portion of the joint from widening under stress. Injury to the MCL often occurs after an impact to the outside of the knee when the knee is slightly bent. The MCL on the inside of the knee becomes stretched and if the force is great enough, some or even all of the fibres will tear. The deep part of ligament is prone to becoming damaged first and this may lead to medial meniscal damage also</Description>

    <Title>Medical attention injuries</Title>
    <Description>The nature of the National Injury and Illness Database is to collect all medico legal requirements of the clinician simultaneously with epidemiological data. Therefore, all medical attention injuries will be recorded. The definition of a medical attention injury is “an assessment of an athlete’s medical condition by a qualified medical/healthcare practitioner”. This definition does not include incidents such as strapping of a joint or other routine care services. These incidents shall be recorded as “maintenance treatments”. Care must be taken when analysing this data as it is likely to overestimate the number of injuries as early presentation is encouraged in Australian elite sporting settings. Consequently, this data is likely to be biased towards minor injuries that are inconsequential to lost time or performance. Systematic bias is also likely where non-uniform care is available.</Description>

At this point, the second rider moves down and with a hand sling from the first rider, transfers their momentum to them through a slinging motion, propelling the second rider into the race.  The original rider then rests until it is their turn to be propelled back into the race. </Description>

    <Title>Metadata</Title>
    <Description>Metadata (meta data, or sometimes metainformation) is "data about data", of any sort in any media. Metadata is text, voice, or image that describes what the audience wants or needs to see or experience. The audience could be a person, group, or software program. Metadata is important because it aids in clarifying and finding the actual data.  An item of metadata may describe an individual datum, or content item, or a collection of data including multiple content items and hierarchical levels, such as a database schema. In data processing, metadata provides information about, or documentation of, other data managed within an application or environment. This commonly defines the structure or schema of the primary data.</Description>

    <Title>Morton's Neuroma</Title>
    <Description>Nerves that transmit messages to the brain from the toes pass between the metatarsal bones (long ones behind the toes). If the arch in the foot is weak then this can cause the metatarsal bones to pinch the nerve causing it to become inflamed. This is most likely to happen between the 3rd and 4th bones causing a pain or numb sensation on the inside of the two toes that the nerve comes from.&#13;</Description>

    <Title>No Ball</Title>
    <Description>In the sport of cricket a no ball is a penalty against the fielding team, usually as a result of an illegal delivery by the bowler. The delivery of a no ball results in one run to be added to the batting team's score, and an additional ball must be bowled. In addition, the number of ways in which the batsman can be given out is reduced. In twenty20 and recently one-day cricket matches, a batsman receives a 'free hit' on the ball after a 'front foot' no ball.  This means the batsman can freely hit the ball with no danger of being out in certain ways. No balls are not uncommon, especially in short form cricket, and fast bowlers tend to bowl them more often than spin bowlers due to their longer run-up.</Description>

    <Title>Not Out</Title>
    <Description>In cricket, not out is a term used on scorecards to signify that a batsman has not been dismissed when the innings is finished. At least one batsman will be not out at the end of an innings. In first class cricket, played over two innings per side, usually only one batsman is not out, as he will have no partner to bat on with when his team is all out. However, in limited overs games, such as One Day Internationals, two batsmen will often be noted as not out, as the innings finishes after a certain number of overs has been bowled.</Description>

    <Title>Number 8</Title>
    <Description>They are the players wearing shirts number 8. It is the only position that is known only by the shirt number. Number Eights must have a good tactical awareness in order to coordinate scrums and ruck moves with the scrum-half. If the ball is at his feet at the back of a scrum, ruck or maul, it is normally the number eight's decision whether to pass the ball out or drive the breakdown on in order to make ground.</Description>

    <Title>Offside (Rugby)</Title>
    <Description>A player is offside when he / she is forward of the relevant offside line i.e. between the relevant offside line and the opposing team's dead ball line. In a match, most players will be offside several times but they only become liable for penalty if they do not act to attempt to become onside (which generally means retreat downfield) or attempt to interfere with play.  In open play, only the ball carrier's team (or the team that last carried or deliberately touched the ball) is bound by offside - the offside line for them is the ball. (Note every player who passes the ball backwards is offside and must attempt to retire.)</Description>

    <Title>Olecranon Bursitis</Title>
    <Description>In cases of olecranon bursitis or students elbow, pain originates from below the tip of the elbow where there is a sack of fluid called a bursa. A bursa is used to help lubricate the movement of tissues such as tendons and muscles, preventing frictions with underlying bones/tissues. This is known as the olecranon bursa as the large protruding end of the Ulna bone (which it protects) is called the olecranon.</Description>

    <Title>Olympic Bar</Title>
    <Description>A men's Olympic bar is a metal bar that is 2.2 m (7.22 ft) long and weighs 20 kg (44.1 lbs). The outer ends are 50 mm (1.9685 in) in diameter, while the grip section is 28 mm (1.1024 in) in diameter. The bars have grip marks spaced 910 mm apart to allow intuitive grip width measurement. It is the standard used in competitive weightlifting where men and women compete at the highest level - the Commonwealth Games, Pan-American Games, World Championships, and the Olympics. The total weight of the barbell varies based on the type and number of plates loaded onto the ends of the bar and the lift being performed and can be as much as 1,000 pounds (450 kg).  A women's Olympic bar is similar to the men's bar, but is shorter 2.05 m (6.73 ft) and lighter 15 kg ( 33.07 lbs) with a smaller grip section diameter (25 mm). Also in contrast to the men's bar, the women's bar does not sport a centre knurl.</Description>

Players who are onside take an active part in playing the game.&#13;&#13;Previously offside players may be "put onside" by the actions of other players (for example, in a kick ahead in open play, players in the kicker's team in front of the kick are offside but can be put onside by the kicker or any other team member who was onside at the time of the kick running up the pitch past them). So that players can be confident they are now onside and can take an active part in the game, the referee may shout "Onside" or "All Onside".</Description>

    <Title>Orienteering</Title>
    <Description>Orienteering is a family of sports that requires navigational skills using a map and compass to navigate from point to point in diverse and usually unfamiliar terrain, and normally moving at speed. Participants are given a topographical map, usually a specially prepared orienteering map, which they use to find control points. Originally a training exercise in land navigation for military officers, orienteering has developed many variations. </Description>

    <Description>Osgood Schlatters disease is a very common cause of knee pain in children and young athletes usually between the ages of 10 and 15. It occurs due to a period of rapid growth, combined with a high level of sporting activity.  These changes result in a pulling force from the patella tendon, on to the tibial tuberosity (bony protrusion at the top of the shin). This area then becomes inflamed, painful and swollen.&#13;&#13;</Description>

    <Title>Oval track</Title>
    <Description>The 400m Standard Track comprises 2 semicircles, each with a radius of 36.50m, which are joined by two straights, each 84.39m in length. The inside edge of the track must have a kerb, that should be coloured white, with a height of 0.05m to 0.065m and a width of 0.05m to 0.25m. The inner edge of the track is 398.116m in length (36.50m x 2 x π + 84.39m x 2) where π = 3.1416. This length for the inner edge gives a length of 400.001m (36.8m x 2 x π + 84.39m x 2) for the theoretical line of running (measurement line) at a distance of 0.30m from the kerb. The inside lane (lane 1) will, therefore, have a length of 400.001m along its theoretical line of running. The length of each of the other lanes is measured along a theoretical line of&#13;running 0.20m from the outer edge of the adjacent inside lane. &#13;&#13;There are three basic types of track surface - synthetic, unbound mineral (cinder) and grass. </Description>

    <Title>Pan Pacific Masters Games</Title>
    <Description>The Pan Pacific Masters Games is an international sporting event held on the Gold Coast at the beginning of November every two years.  Around 10,000 participants from all over the world compete in the multi-sport competition, which runs for one week at various venues across the city. The minimum age requirement is 30 years of age for most.  The Pan Pacific Masters Games first began on the Gold Coast in 1996 and was originally called the Queensland Masters Games.  In 1998 it became the larger Asia Pacific Masters Games which were held three more times on the Gold Coast - in 1998, 2000 and 2002.  The event was renamed the Pan Pacific Masters Games in 2002 to reflect growing interest from Asia, Japan, the Americas, Oceania and New Zealand.  http://www.mastersgames.com.au  </Description>

A fairly uncommon condition is when the back of the joint gets swollen and causes the bursa to swell also. Usually some disorder of the knee causes the synovial (lubricating) fluid within the knee joint to increase. This then spills into the bursa at the back of the knee causing it to increase in size.</Description>

    <Title>Posterior Cruciate Ligament Injury</Title>
    <Description>The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) functions mainly in preventing the tibia from traveling backwards on the femur, known as posterior drawer. It also helps to prevent the tibia from twisting outwards. Injury to the ligament leads to knee instability with the shin bone having a tendency to 'sag' backwards when the knee is bent at 90 degrees.&#13;&#13;</Description>

    <Title>Powerlifting (Paralympic Sport)</Title>
    <Description>Powerlifting for athletes with a disability made its first appearance in 1964 at the second Paralympic Games in Tokyo as �Weightlifting�. Later it changed from �Weightlifting� to �Powerlifting�. The competition is open to all athletes with cerebral palsy, spinal injuries, short stature, amputees (lower limb amputees only) and les autres who meet minimal disability criteria. Powerlifting is the ultimate test of upper body strength. Competitors must lower the bar to the chest, hold it motionless on the chest and then press it upwards to arms length with locked elbows. The bench press is the only discipline with 10 different categories based on body weight. The athletes are given three attempts and the winner is the athlete who lifts the highest number of kilograms.&#13;</Description>

    <Title>Prevalence of injury and illness problems</Title>
    <Description>Many injuries and illness do not result in loss of training or competition time. The National Injury and Illness Database has adopted the scoring system proposed by Clarsen et. al. where the proposed definition of a recordable incident (injury or illness) is inappropriate. For example, the prevalence of shoulder pain in Australian water polo players is currently monitored via weekly questionnaires based on the Clarsen method. It is expected that this method will be adopted where appropriate among NSOs into the future. The Clarsen method requires input from the athlete and where this is unobtainable it is possible to measure the prevalence of missed or modified training and competition due to injury or illness from participation records. This allows similar data to be collected without the reliance of athlete self-reports.</Description>

    <Title>Rapid Dribbling</Title>
    <Description>This distinct type of dribbling can only be performed while the ball is low to the ground and with little bounce. It involves slapping the ball rapidly, either with one hand or alternating between both hands, creating the necessary rhythm of slaps and bounces needed to keep the ball bouncing. Gradually increasing the strength of slaps and broadening the rhythm results in "lifting" the ball up, where a normal dribble may be resumed.</Description>

    <Title>Rating of perceived exertion</Title>
    <Description>A way of measuring physical activity intensity level. Perceived exertion is how hard you feel like your body is working. It is based on the physical sensations a person experiences during physical activity, including increased heart rate, increased respiration or breathing rate, increased sweating, and muscle fatigue. Although this is a subjective measure, a person's exertion rating may provide a fairly good estimate of the actual heart rate during physical activity. </Description>

    <Title>Reactive Oxygen Species</Title>
    <Description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are ions or very small molecules that include oxygen ions, free radicals, and peroxides, both inorganic and organic.They are highly reactive due to the presence of unpaired valence shell electrons. ROS form as a natural byproduct of the normal metabolism of oxygen and have important roles in cell signaling. However, during times of environmental stress (such as for example, UV or heat exposure) ROS levels can increase dramatically, which can result in significant damage to cell structures. This cumulates into a situation known as oxidative stress. They are also generated by exogenous sources such as ionizing radiation.&#13;</Description>

    <Title>Reviewing a Play</Title>
    <Description>Officials using an instant reply machine can review plays. Each team is given two challenges per game. That is, if a team thinks that an official made a wrong call on a play they can ask the referee to review the play and they do this by throwing a red flag unto the field where a referee can see it. The instant replay takes place by the referee looking into a monitor on the field. He first consults with the official who made the call on the play. The referee looks at a monitor and if he feels that there is incontrovertible visual evidence or it is beyond doubt that a mistake was made, then the referee can change the call that was made. But if there is not incontrovertible evidence then the play stands as called. The reviews are not suppose to take longer than 90 seconds, from the time the referee starts to look at the replay. If the play is not changed then the team that made the challenge loses a time out.</Description>

    <Title>Ruck</Title>
    <Description>A ruck is formed when the ball is on the ground and two opposing players meet over the ball. The offside line becomes the last foot of the last man on each side of the ruck and players compete for the ball by attempting to drive one another from the area and to 'ruck' the ball backwards with their feet.  Rucks commonly form at tackles, but can form anywhere in the field of play where the ball is on the ground. Handling the ball while it is in the vicinity of a ruck is a penalty offence. (Though modern practice allows a player on the ground to support the ball with his / her hands and for the player who is acting as scrum half to 'dig' for the ball once possession has been secured.) If the ball does not come out of a ruck after about five seconds, the referee will award a scrum to the team he considers to have been moving forward in the ruck.</Description>

    <Title>Run (Cricket)</Title>
    <Description>In the sport of cricket, a run is the basic unit of scoring. Runs are scored by a batsman, and the aggregate of the scores of a team's batsmen (plus any extras) constitutes the team's score. A batsman scoring 50 (a 'half century') or 100 runs (a 'century' or 'ton'), or any higher multiple of 50 runs, is considered a particular achievement. By extension, a partnership of two batsmen moving the team score on by a multiple of 50 runs, or the team score passing a multiple of 50 runs, is also cause for celebration.</Description>

    <Title>Scrum</Title>
    <Description>The eight forwards from each team bind together and push against each other. The scrum-half from the team that has been awarded possession feeds the ball into the centre of the scrum from the side most advantageous for his hooker (which is typically the side of loose head prop).  The ball must be fed straight down the middle of the tunnel and the hookers must not contest for the ball until it is put in. If they do, a free-kick is awarded for "foot up".  The scrum is taken again if the ball comes straight out of the tunnel or if it collapses. If the scrum wheels (rotates) due to pushing more than 90 degrees the scrum is reformed and awarded to the other side. Pulling in an attempt to unbalance the other side or to assist in rotating the scrum is a Penalty Offence.</Description>

    <Title>Scrum half</Title>
    <Description>Also known as a half-back, they are the players traditionally wearing shirt number 9. Scrum halves form the all-important link between the forwards and the backs. They are relatively small but with a high degree of vision, the ability to react to situations very quickly, and good handling skills.  They are often the first tackler in defence and are behind every scrum, maul or ruck to get the ball out and maintain movement. They put the ball into the scrum and collect it afterwards. Scrum Halves generally also act as "receiver" in the line-out to catch the ball knocked down by the forwards. (The receiver is a member of the line out and so stands within 10 metres of it and may join the line once the ball is thrown.)</Description>

The National Injury and Illness Database will use this grading system and report severity in relation to training days modified (definition above) and missed completely (athlete advised not to undertake training of any modality).</Description>

    <Title>Shot Clock (Basketball)</Title>
    <Description>In basketball, the shot clock is a timer designed to increase the pace (and consequently, the score) in games. The offensive team must attempt a field goal before the shot clock expires, and the ball must then either touch the rim or enter the basket, or the offensive team will be assessed a violation resulting in loss of possession. However if the ball leaves the hand of the player before the shot clock goes off and makes it or hits the rim, it's not a violation. In basketball the shot clock is set at 24 seconds.&#13;&#13;</Description>

    <Title>Slider (Cricket)</Title>
    <Description>In cricket, a slider is a type of delivery bowled by a wrist spin bowler. Whereas a topspinner is released with the thumb facing the batsman, a slider is bowled with the thumb facing the bowler. On release the wrist and ring finger work to impart backspin to the ball. A topspinner tends to dip more quickly and bounce higher than a normal delivery. The slider does the opposite: it floats to a fuller length and bounces less than the batsman might expect.</Description>

    <Title>Sliding Defence</Title>
    <Description>The sliding defence requires that gaps are left at either edge of the field at the end of the defensive line, which aims to squeeze more players around the area of play. This allows the line to be at its strongest around the position of play, thus leaving the attacking side less opportunity to run through the line. Should the attacking side move the ball towards one edge of the field in an attempt to go around the defensive line, then the entire defensive line will move in that direction.  This is known as sliding.</Description>

    <Description>The Sonar class has a crew of three, a fixed keel, a length of 7m (23 feet), and a weight of 950kg. Sonar has three sails - main sail, jib, and spinnaker, but when used for Paralympic sailing, the crew uses the mainsail and jib only. The Sonar provides the option of sailing together with a crew of various disabilities and, because of its size and flexibility, allows many different adaptive aids to be incorporated into the boats to assist those sailors with more severe disabilities.</Description>

    <Description>Special Olympics welcomes all athletes with intellectual disabilities, (ages 8 and older) of all ability levels, to train and compete in 30 Olympic-type sports. To be eligible to participate in Special Olympics, athletes must have an intellectual disability; a cognitive delay, or a development disability, that is, functional limitations in both general learning and adaptive skills. (They may also have a physical disability.)&#13;&#13;Special Olympics believes deeply in the power of sports to help all who participate to fulfill their potential and does not exclude any athlete based upon qualifying scores, but rather divisions the athletes based on those scores for fair competition against others of like ability. For Special Olympics athletes’ excellence is personal achievement, a reflection of reaching one's maximum potential-- a goal to which everyone can aspire.&#13;&#13;(Source: http://media.specialolympics.org/soi/files/press-kit/What's%20the%20difference%20SO%20and%20Paralympics.pdf)</Description>

    <Title>Stick (Alpine Skiing) (Paralympic Sport)</Title>
    <Description>The word Hockey comes from the French word hocquet, which means hooked stick. In Ice Sledge Hockey, players use two sticks with a hooked wooden blade at one end (for puck handling and ambidextrous shooting) and a pick at the other end. Each stick has a maximum length of 1m and is made of wood, plastic or aluminium / titanium. The blade has a maximum length of 25cm, except for the goaltender's blade, which has a maximum length of 35cm. The pick end of the stick must not damage the ice surface or inadvertently puncture or slash other players, so the following rules apply: No part of the pick or teeth may come to a sharp point, the pick must not extend more than 1cm anywhere beyond the stick, the pick must have at least six teeth, each with a maximum length of 4mm.  The goaltender may have an additional pick at the base end of his stick. The goaltender may also use an additional stick with a blade or a trapper glove with teeth.&#13;</Description>

    <Title>Surrender Tackle</Title>
    <Description>A referee may call "Surrender!" as a player is tackled to indicate that they have judged the player in possession to have allowed themselves to be tackled by diving to the ground or by collapsing in the tackle. The referee will allow the defending team more time to release the tackled player. The intention of the player in possession is to gain an unfair advantage by having a speedy play-the-ball and resumption of play so that their team can press their advantage by reducing the amount of time available for the defending team to organise their defence. The player in possession aims to allowing the tackle to be completed on their own terms, for example their body position, letting them more easily regain their feet.</Description>

    <Title>Swimming (Paralympic Sport)</Title>
    <Description>Since the first Paralympic Games in Rome in 1960, swimming has been one of the main sports of the Paralympics. Like the Olympic Games, competitors measure their skills in freestyle, backstroke, butterfly, breaststroke and medley events. Swimming is open to both male and female competitors who have a physical disability, intellectual disability or blindness / visual impairment. Athletes are classified based on their functional ability to perform each stroke. The International Swimming Federation (FINA) rules are followed with a few modifications, such as optional platform or in-water starts for some races, and the use of signals or tappers for swimmers with blindness / visual impairment. No prostheses or assistive devices are permitted. &#13;</Description>

    <Title>Table Tennis (Paralympic Sport)</Title>
    <Description>Table tennis was included in the first Paralympic Games in 1960. Athletes from all disability groups (with the exception of athletes with blindness / visual impairment) participate and compete in table tennis in standing and sitting (wheelchair) classes.  Men and women compete individually and in doubles, as well as in team events. A match comprises five sets of 11 points each and the winner is the player or pair winning three of the five sets. The rules of the International Table Tennis Federation  also apply to the Paralympic table tennis competitions with slight modifications regarding the serve rules for athletes competing in a wheelchair. &#13;&#13;</Description>

    <Title>Tap tackle</Title>
    <Description>Despite its name, a tap tackle is a not actually a tackle as the ball carrier is brought to ground by a form of trip, is not actually held on the ground and may attempt to get up and continue to run. A tap tackle is used when a defending player is unable to get close enough to the ball carrier but is able to dive at the other player's feet and, with outstretched arm, deliver a tap or hook to the player's foot (or feet) causing the player to stumble. At speed, this will often be sufficient to bring the ball-carrier down, allowing a team-mate of the tackling player to retrieve the ball or provide sufficient delay for the defending team to organise a defence.</Description>

    <Title>Ten Metre Law</Title>
    <Description>The Ten Metre Law is a form of offside which is designed to prevent injury to a defending player who attempts to catch a ball that has been kicked ahead by the attacking side.  In the normal Law of Offside in open play, it is possible for an offside player to be put onside by actions of the opposing team. This ability to be put onside by a member of the opposing team does not apply if the offside player was within 10 metres along the field of a defending player waiting to catch the ball and the offside player remains offside until either he/she retreats onside or is put onside by a member of their own team.</Description>

They are classified according to their capabilities and may use adapted equipment to assist their movement - for example, paraplegic competitors or wheelchair users may use a manual bicycle called a handcycle, turning the pedals with their hands, for the cycling stage, and compete in the race in a wheelchair.&#13;The five classes of paratriathlon are defined by the International Triathlon Union (ITU), using a specific scoring system represented by the acronym PT. &#13;The Triathlon course includes a 750m swim, a 20km cycle and a 5km race, a distance known as the triathlon sprint. As in the Olympic version of the sport, time spent in transition between swimming, cycling and running is included in the total event time, and the athlete who completes the course in the least time wins.</Description>

    <Title>Try</Title>
    <Description>It is the primary method of scoring. A try is worth five points. It is scored when a player places the ball on the ground with downward pressure in the in-goal area between (and including) the goal-line and up to but not including dead ball line of the opposition's half. (As the goal posts and post protectors are also part of the goal-line, touching the ball down against the base of these is also a try.)  There is no such thing as an "own try". If you touch the ball down in your own in-goal area, it results in a twenty-two metre drop out or a five metre scrum.</Description>

    <Description>Turf toe can occur after a very vigorous upward bending of the big toe. It got it's name due to the fact that it occurs frequently in people who play games on artificial surfaces. The shoe grips hard on the surface and sticks causing bodyweight to go forward and so bending the toe up. It is also common in martial arts. You are more at risk if you have increased range of motion in the ankle and / or wear soft flexible shoes.&#13;&#13;</Description>

    <Title>Ultimate Frisbee</Title>
    <Description>Ultimate is a sport played with a flying disc (frisbee). The object of the game is to score points by passing the disc to a player in the opposing end zone, similar to an end zone in American football or the in-goal area in rugby. Players may not run with the disc, and must keep a pivot while holding the disc. The word "ultimate" in the title refers to the fact that, since originally there were to be no referees, the game required the ultimate in honour to play.&#13;</Description>

    <Title>Umbrella Defence</Title>
    <Description>The umbrella defence (or up and in defence) requires that players do not spread across the entire field. The defensive line is particularly vulnerable on the edges around the wings, therefore the best defensive measure in this case is a preventative measure. That is, the aim becomes to prevent the attacking team from going to the wings or to disrupt any passes towards the edge of the field. This requires that defensive players (wingers or centres) on the edge of the defensive line move up faster than those in the middle of the line.</Description>

    <Title>Vigoro</Title>
    <Description>Vigoro is a sport that combines elements of cricket and baseball and is mainly played in Australia by women. &#13;&#13;Vigoro is played on a pitch slightly shorter in length than a cricket pitch. The balls are much lighter than those for cricket, and the bat has a different shape with a long handle resembling the shape of a paddle.&#13;&#13;There are two teams of 12 players which will bat and field two innings each (except in the event that a team wins with an innings in hand). The aim of the game is for a team to score more runs than the opposition team.&#13;&#13;There are no overs and the batters bat from one end only. Two bowlers bowl alternately and can incorporate any type of "throwing" action as long as the ball is released above the shoulder (i.e. not underarm).&#13;&#13;If the ball is hit forward of the crease, the batters must run.&#13;&#13;A run is completed each time both batters safely make it to the crease at the opposite end of the pitch. Fours and sixes also apply where the batter hits the ball past the boundary markers. In addition to shots made off the bat, byes and leg-byes add to the team's score.&#13;&#13;Players may be dismissed by the same methods as in cricket – bowled, caught, run out, stumped, leg before wicket, hit wicket, handled ball and hit the ball twice.</Description>

    <Title>Wheelchair Basketball (Paralympic Sport)</Title>
    <Description>Wheelchair basketball was one of the foundation sports on the Paralympic program in Rome in 1960. Today, it continues to be one of the most popular sports at the Paralympic Games. To be eligible to play wheelchair basketball, a person must in their lower limbs have an objective and measurable permanent physical disability, which prevents them from running, jumping and pivoting as an able-bodied player. By classification, players are assigned a point value from 1.0 to 4.5 according to their level of physical function. These points are then added together in a game where a team is not permitted to exceed 14.0 points for the five players on court. This ensures that any player regardless of degree of disability, has an integral role to play in the team structure. Observed trunk movements and stability during actual basketball participation, not medical diagnosis form the basis of player classification. &#13;</Description>

    <Title>Wheelchair Rugby (Paralympic Sport)</Title>
    <Description>Wheelchair rugby is an intense, physical team sport for male and female athletes with quadriplegia (tetraplegia). The sport can be very physical as athletes attempt to carry the ball over the opponent's goal line. The players are classified according to their level of functional ability and are assigned a point value from 0.5 to 3.5 points, the higher the points, the more functional ability the athletes have. The four players on the court cannot exceed a combined total of 8 points. A volleyball is used and it can be carried, dribbled, or passed in any way except by kicking. The ball must be bounced at least once every 10 seconds and rugby is played in eight-minute quarters. &#13;</Description>

    <Title>Wheelchair Tennis (Paralympic Sport)</Title>
    <Description>Wheelchair tennis appeared for the first time on the Paralympic Program in Barcelona in 1992. The game follows able-bodied tennis rules and athletes must have high levels of skill, fitness and strategy. The only difference in wheelchair tennis competitions is that the ball is allowed to bounce twice - the first bounce being within the bounds of the court. Athletes must have a permanent substantial or total loss of function in one or both legs. For the quad division the eligibility criteria requires a player to have a disability in three or more limbs. The events are singles (between two players) and doubles (between two pairs). The winner of a match is the first athlete or pair to win two sets. &#13;</Description>

    <Title>Yellow Card (Rugby)</Title>
    <Description>In International matches, a yellow card is shown to a player who has been cautioned to indicate "temporary suspension" for repeated or deliberate infringements of the rules. The offending player is sent to the sin bin for at least 10 minutes while his team must play a man short. (A player who is temporarily suspended cannot return to the pitch until the first break in play after his / her 10 minute suspension is completed.)  In domestic matches, yellow cards are commonly used in exactly the same manner as in International matches but this is not required by regulation so a referee may order the temporary suspension of a player without showing a yellow card. </Description>
