Many teams employ two or three slips (numbered from the slip fielder closest to the wicket-keeper: first slip, second slip, etc.). A floating slip is sometimes employed, usually in limited over games, who patrols an area in the slip cordon that would ordinarily be occupied by more than one fielder. The slip cordon's distance from the batsman increases with the pace of the bowler. Generally they will be marginally further away from the batsman than the wicketkeeper is. Because of the resulting geometry, spin bowlers generally have fewer slips in the cordon than a fast bowler would in an equivalent game situation. As fielding in the slips requires quick reflexes and sure hands, usually the most adept catchers in the team will make up the slip cordon. Most slip fielders are top order batsmen. Specialist slip fielders are sometimes called slippers.", "RelatedTerms": [{"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "Fielding positions"}], "Title": "First Slip"}, {"Description": "Instantaneous velocity of vertex of head when hands part to commence stroke cycle.", "RelatedTerms": [{"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "Turns (Swimming)"}], "Title": "First Stroke"}, {"Description": "Federation Internationale de Ski - includes Alpine, Nordic Combined, Cross Country, Freestyle, Ski Jumping and Snowboarding.", "RelatedTerms": [{"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "Alpine Skiing organisations"}, {"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "Freestyle Skiing organisations"}, {"Relationship": "Used For", "Title": "Federation Internationale de Ski"}, {"Relationship": "Used For", "Title": "International Ski Federation"}, {"Relationship": "Used For", "Title": "Internationler Ski Verband"}], "Title": "FIS"}, {"Description": "http://www.fis-ski.com/", "RelatedTerms": [{"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "Cross Country Skiing competitions"}, {"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "International competitions"}, {"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "Skiing competitions"}], "Title": "FIS Cross Country World Cup"}, {"Description": "http://www.mthotham.com.au", "RelatedTerms": [{"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "Alpine Skiing competitions"}, {"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "International competitions"}, {"Relationship": "Related", "Title": "Alpine Skiing"}], "Title": "FIS Hotham Australia New Zealand Cup (skiing)"}, {"Description": "Federation Internationale des Societes d'Aviron (International Rowing Federation) www.worldrowing.com ", "RelatedTerms": [{"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "International Sporting Organisation"}, {"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "Rowing organisations"}, {"Relationship": "Used For", "Title": "Federation Internationale des Societes d'Aviron"}, {"Relationship": "Used For", "Title": "International Rowing Federation"}], "Title": "FISA"}, {"Description": "http://www.worldrowing.com/", "RelatedTerms": [{"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "Rowing competitions"}], "Title": "FISA World Cup"}, {"Description": "http://www.worldrowing.com/", "RelatedTerms": [{"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "Rowing competitions"}], "Title": "FISA World Rowing Championships"}, {"Description": "Fiscal year is the twelve-month period over which an entity reports on the activities that appear in its annual financial statements.", "RelatedTerms": [{"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "Finance"}], "Title": "Fiscal Year"}, {"Description": "The proper distance between the handle of a bow and the bow string when the bow is strung.", "RelatedTerms": [{"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "Bow (Archery)"}], "Title": "Fistmele"}, {"Description": "Federation Internationale De Tir A L'arc (International Archery Federation) www.fita.org ", "RelatedTerms": [{"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "Archery organisations"}, {"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "International Sporting Organisation"}, {"Relationship": "Used For", "Title": "Federation Internationale de Tir a L'Arc"}, {"Relationship": "Used For", "Title": "International Archery Federation"}], "Title": "FITA"}, {"Description": "A qualified instructor that provides advice and guidance on exercise and training routines to promote increased strength, flexibility and performance.", "RelatedTerms": [{"Relationship": "Narrower Term", "Title": "Sport personnel"}], "Title": "Fitness trainer "}, {"Description": "The process of refurbishing a workplace internally.

The objective is to throw a ball through a bottomless basket (Korf) that is mounted on a 3.5 m (11.5 feet) high pole. Teams of eight players divide into two sections, two male, two female in each section. The korfball playing area consists of two large squares joined along the centre line, within each square is a \u2018korf\u2019 set in one third from the back line. The sport was developed in the Netherlands by school-teacher Nico Broekhuysen who founded the sport in 1902 so that boys and girls could play together on equal terms, encouraging team work and cooperation. One section starts the game in attack, the other in defence, but players swap roles after every two goals scored throughout the game. The sport is based on cooperation within the team, and the rules provide equality \u2013 players can only mark or be marked by an opposing player of the same sex.

Athletes with various types of disabilities may take part in the sport, including wheelchair users, amputees and visually impaired athletes. They are classified according to their capabilities and may use adapted equipment to assist their movement - for example, paraplegic competitors or wheelchair users may use a manual bicycle called a handcycle, turning the pedals with their hands, for the cycling stage, and compete in the race in a wheelchair. The five classes of paratriathlon are defined by the International Triathlon Union (ITU), using a specific scoring system represented by the acronym PT.  The Triathlon course includes a 750m swim, a 20km cycle and a 5km race, a distance known as the triathlon sprint.

Vigoro is played on a pitch slightly shorter in length than a cricket pitch. The balls are much lighter than those for cricket, and the bat has a different shape with a long handle resembling the shape of a paddle.  There are two teams of 12 players which will bat and field two innings each (except in the event that a team wins with an innings in hand). The aim of the game is for a team to score more runs than the opposition team.  There are no overs and the batters bat from one end only. Two bowlers bowl alternately and can incorporate any type of \"throwing\" action as long as the ball is released above the shoulder (i.e. not underarm).  If the ball is hit forward of the crease, the batters must run.  A run is completed each time both batters safely make it to the crease at the opposite end of the pitch. Fours and sixes also apply where the batter hits the ball past the boundary markers. In addition to shots made off the bat, byes and leg-byes add to the team's score.

Today, it continues to be one of the most popular sports at the Paralympic Games. To be eligible to play wheelchair basketball, a person must in their lower limbs have an objective and measurable permanent physical disability, which prevents them from running, jumping and pivoting as an able-bodied player. By classification, players are assigned a point value from 1.0 to 4.5 according to their level of physical function. These points are then added together in a game where a team is not permitted to exceed 14.0 points for the five players on court. This ensures that any player regardless of degree of disability, has an integral role to play in the team structure. Observed trunk movements and stability during actual basketball participation, not medical diagnosis form the basis of player classification.
